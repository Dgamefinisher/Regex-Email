### Defining Regex Variables ###

When using regex variables in any of the sections of the program they are to be defined using <var name> such as:

Hello <Name> I was wondering when you expect to have <task>.
where <Name> and <task> are the variables (not-case sensitive)

### Subject cloning ###

As outlined in the descriptions to use a subject line again you must place (number) in the line corresponding to the line and thereby the person you want to send the email to.

The program enumerates email addresses, subject lines, and email contents between 2 /\p's and sends all of the contents with the same number to the same person.


If the email address line looked like this,

contoso@onmicrosoft.com
John_kim@gmail.com
Amber_C@outlook.com

and the subject lines looked like this,

Lunch
Updates
Friday plans

the first email adress recieves the first subject line and so on.

now if the subject lines looked like this.

Lunch
()
()

all three people recieve the same subject. However including a blank paranthesis before a subject such as,

()
lunch
()

will send the first email without a subject.
