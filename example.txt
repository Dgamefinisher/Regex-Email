### Defining Regex Variables ###

When using regex variables in any of the sections of the program they are to be defined using <var name> such as:

Hello <Name> I was wondering when you expect to have <task>.
where <Name> and <task> are the variables (not-case sensitive)

### Subject cloning ###

As outlined in the descriptions to use a subject line again you can utilize a variable encased in <> in the line corresponding to the line and thereby the person you want to send the email to.

The program enumerates email addresses, subject lines, and email contents with a newline as a delimiter and sends all of the contents with the same number to the same person.


If the email address line looked like this,

contoso@onmicrosoft.azure.com
John_kim@gmail.com
Amber_C@outlook.com

and the subject lines looked like this,

Lunch
Updates
Friday plans

the first email adress recieves the first subject line and so on.
However the power of the script resides in the fact that variables can be used to send the same thing in multiple lines. For example say that I want to send an email to five different members of the same organization. Instead of typing out the lengthy email each time I could change it with a variable:

Address List
____________________________
contoso@onmicrosoft.azure.com
James-k@onmicrosoft.azure.com
Filipe3@onmicrosoft.azure.com
...

Replaced with
_____________________________
contoso<mail>
James-k<mail>
Filipe3<mail>

As long as the variables are defined in "Define Vars the switch will happen automagically"

### Defining Variables ###

<Variable Name>: what the varible actually is

due to limitations in variable buffer sizes of smaller chips there isn't currently support for variable stacking or defining variables using other variables. so you can't do the following:
<Variable Name>:<Other Variable> cat
